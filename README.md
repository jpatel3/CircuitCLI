# CircuitAI

[![CI](https://github.com/jpatel3/CircuitCLI/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jpatel3/CircuitCLI/actions)

**Your Personal Command Center — local-first, privacy-focused.**

All data stays on your machine in an encrypted SQLite database. Agent-native design with `--json` mode for AI agents and a rich terminal experience for humans.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install -e .

# Initialize (set master password, create encrypted DB)
circuit setup

# Launch the interactive REPL
circuit

# Or use commands directly
circuit --help
```

## Features

- **Interactive REPL** — type naturally or use `/commands` with tab completion and history
- **Morning Catchup** — `circuit morning` for a daily financial briefing
- **Bill Tracking** — recurring bills with payment history, due-date alerts, and auto-matching
- **Bank Accounts** — balance tracking, transaction import, and statement linking
- **Credit Cards** — balance, limit, utilization tracking
- **Mortgage** — amortization schedule, payments, and equity tracking
- **Investments** — brokerage, 401(k), 529, IRA portfolio tracking
- **Deadlines** — priority-based deadline management with calendar sync
- **Kids Activities** — per-child, per-sport cost and schedule tracking
- **Natural Language Input** — `circuit add "paid electric bill $142"` parses and records
- **Natural Language Queries** — `circuit query "what bills are due this week?"`, `"show my account balances"`, `"what's my net worth?"`
- **Textual Dashboard** — full TUI with `circuit dashboard`
- **CalDAV Calendar Sync** — two-way sync with Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, etc.
- **Plugin System** — extensible via Python entry-point adapters
- **CSV Import** — import bank/card statements from CSV files
- **Export** — CSV and JSON export for all data types
- **Undo** — revert the last destructive operation (supports add, pay, complete, delete, and update across all entity types: bills, accounts, cards, deadlines, activities, investments, mortgages)
- **Agent-Native** — every command supports `--json` for AI agent consumption

Every command supports `--json` for structured output:

```bash

circuit bills --json summary
```

## Interactive REPL

Launch with `circuit` (no subcommand). The REPL supports slash commands and natural language:

```
circuit> /bills list
circuit> /morning
circuit> paid electric bill $142
circuit> what bills are due this week?
circuit> /undo
circuit> /quit
```

### Slash Commands

All 18 slash commands: `/bills`, `/accounts`, `/cards`, `/mortgage`, `/investments`, `/deadlines`, `/activities`, `/morning`, `/dashboard`, `/calendar`, `/adapters`, `/export`, `/sync`, `/settings`, `/help`, `/undo`, `/query`, `/quit`

### Natural Language

The REPL detects natural language automatically:
- **Questions** — `what bills are due this week?`, `show my account balances`, `what's my net worth?`
- **Actions** — keywords like `paid`, `add`, and `complete` are recognized with confidence scoring
- **Fallback** — unrecognized input is passed to the query engine

Word completion and persistent history file are built in.

## TUI Dashboard

Launch with `circuit dashboard` or `/dashboard` in the REPL.

The dashboard displays 7 panels: financial summary, bills, accounts, cards, deadlines, investments, and activities. Click or press Enter on any panel to drill down into a detail screen.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` / `Escape` | Quit |
| `r` | Refresh |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Navigate between panels |

## Morning Catchup

```bash
circuit morning
```

Shows a daily briefing with:
- **Attention items** sorted by urgency — overdue deadlines, bills due today, upcoming deadlines
- **Bills due** in the next 7 days (smart filtering skips recently-paid bills within 25 days)
- **Today's activity schedule**
- **Accounts and cards snapshot** — balances and utilization

## Seed Data

Load demo data for testing or exploration:

```bash
circuit seed --profile demo      # full demo dataset
circuit seed --profile minimal   # minimal starter data
```

The `demo` profile populates: 4 bank accounts, 3 credit cards, 10 bills, 1 mortgage, 6 investments, 2 children, 4 activities, and 2 deadlines.

## Export

Export your data to CSV or JSON:

```bash
circuit export csv --entity bills
circuit export json --entity all
circuit export csv --entity accounts -o accounts.csv
```

Supported entity types: `bills`, `accounts`, `cards`, `investments`, `deadlines`, `activities` (plus `all` for JSON export). Use `-o <file>` to write to a file instead of stdout.

## JSON / Agent-Native Mode

Every command wraps output in a `{"status": "success", "data": ...}` envelope:

```bash
$ circuit --json bills list
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "abc-123",
      "name": "Electric",
      "amount_cents": 14200,
      "due_day": 15,
      "frequency": "monthly"
    }
  ]
}
```

Errors return `{"status": "error", "error": {"message": "...", "code": 1}}`.

This makes CircuitAI a natural backend for AI agents and automation scripts.

## Integrations & Plugin System

View all integrations (adapters + built-in services):

```bash
circuit integrations
circuit integrations list --kind adapter
circuit integrations info calendar-sync
```

### Built-in Services

| Integration | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `calendar-sync` | Two-way CalDAV sync for bills, deadlines, and activities |
| `statement-linker` | Auto-match imported transactions to known bills |
| `text-parser` | Convert natural language to structured financial entries |
| `query-engine` | Answer natural language questions about your data |

### Adapter Plugins

CircuitAI discovers adapters via Python entry points. Built-in adapters:

| Adapter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `manual` | Manual data entry via CLI commands |
| `csv-import` | Import transactions from CSV bank/card statements |

Anyone can create and publish an adapter as a standalone Python package. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the 3-step process.

## CalDAV Calendar Sync

Sync bills, deadlines, and activities to any CalDAV server (Apple Calendar, Google, Nextcloud, etc.):

```bash
pip install -e ".[calendar]"   # install caldav dependency
circuit calendar setup         # configure server URL + credentials
circuit calendar sync          # push/pull events
circuit calendar status        # check sync status
```

## Encryption

CircuitAI uses SQLCipher for at-rest encryption. Your data never leaves your machine.

```bash
pip install -e ".[crypto]"     # install sqlcipher dependency
circuit setup                  # set master password
```

Without SQLCipher installed, CircuitAI falls back to plain SQLite (still local-only).

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+** — type hints throughout
- **Click** — CLI framework with nested command groups
- **Rich** — tables, panels, and styled terminal output
- **Textual** — full TUI dashboard
- **Pydantic** — data validation and serialization
- **prompt_toolkit** — REPL with history and completion
- **SQLite / SQLCipher** — local encrypted storage
- **CalDAV** — optional calendar sync

## Testing & CI

```bash
python -m pytest               # run all tests
python -m pytest -x            # stop on first failure
```

102 tests across 10 test files covering CLI commands, services, repositories, and adapters. GitHub Actions CI runs on Python 3.11 and 3.12 with Ruff linting, pytest, and build verification.
